Lets get started,

1.Introduction

The Serverless Framework Python project is a sample application designed to demonstrate image upload, thumbnail generation, and storage in the cloud using AWS services. The project utilizes AWS Lambda functions, API Gateway, S3 bucket, and SQS queue for its functionality.

2.Getting Started

# Prerequisites

  1. Python 3.7 or higher
  2. Node.js and npm
  3. Serverless Framework CLI

    npm install -g serverless
    serverless plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements

  4. AWS account with credentials configured

# Installation
Clone the project repository.
Navigate to the project directory.
Install project dependencies,

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up AWS credentials either via environment variables or AWS CLI.

# Configuration
Update serverless.yml file with your desired configuration settings, such as AWS region, S3 bucket name, etc.

3.Project Structure

The project directory structure is as follows:

serverless-framework-python/

    ├── src
        ├──handler.py
    ├── test
        ├──test_handler.py
    ├── serverless.yml
    └── requirements.txt

handler.py: Contains the Lambda function handlers for image upload, thumbnail generation, and image/thumbnail retrieval.

serverless.yml: Serverless Framework configuration file defining AWS resources and function events.

requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required for the project.

4.Implementation Details

The project implements the following components:

 1. Lambda functions for image upload, thumbnail generation, and image/thumbnail retrieval.

 2. API Gateway endpoints for uploading images and retrieving images/thumbnails.

 3. S3 bucket for storing uploaded images and generated thumbnails.

 4. SQS queue for triggering thumbnail generation upon image upload.

5.API Documentation

APIs
 1. Image Upload API

        Endpoint: /upload
        Method: POST
        Request Body: Image file
        Response: JSON containing uploaded image URL

 2. Image Download API

        Endpoint: /image/{imageName}
        Method: GET
        Response: Image data

3. Thumbnail Download API

        Endpoint: /thumbnail/{imageName}
        Method: GET
        Response: Thumbnail image data

6.Testing

Use an HTTP client to test API endpoints locally or deploy the project to AWS for testing.
Verify functionality by uploading images, retrieving images, and downloading thumbnails.

7.Deployment

# Deploy the project to AWS using serverless deploy.
    serverless deploy

8.Conclusion

The Serverless Framework Python project provides a simple implementation for image upload, thumbnail generation, and storage in the cloud. By leveraging AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and SQS, the project demonstrates a scalable and cost-effective approach to handling image-related tasks in serverless environment.
